Based on the provided code snippet, it appears that you've developed a Rust project, possibly related to a smart contract or token functionality. The project seems to be structured into modules (`admin`, `allowance`, `balance`, `contract`, `metadata`, `storage_types`, `test`) and defines a public interface (`TokenClient`) through the `contract` module.

Here's a suggested README template for your project:

# Rust Token Contract

## Introduction

This Rust project implements a token contract, providing functionality for managing tokens on a blockchain platform. It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with `no_std` environments.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: The project is organized into several modules, each handling a specific aspect of the token functionality (`admin`, `allowance`, `balance`, `contract`, `metadata`, `storage_types`, `test`).
- **Token Client Interface**: The `TokenClient` interface, exposed through the `contract` module, provides a public API for interacting with the token contract.
- **Blockchain Compatibility**: The project is designed to work in blockchain environments, offering essential features for token management.

## Usage

To use this token contract in your Rust project, follow these steps:

1. Add the project as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    token-contract = { git = "https://github.com/yourusername/token-contract.git" }
    ```

2. Import the `TokenClient` interface into your Rust code:

    ```rust
    use token_contract::TokenClient;
    ```

3. Initialize the token client and start interacting with the token contract:

    ```rust
    // Example usage
    let mut token_client = TokenClient::new();
    // Use token_client methods to interact with the contract
    ```
